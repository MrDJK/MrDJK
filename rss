            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>As I stand on the threshold of a new chapter in my personal and professional
journey, I am still filled with a sense of hope, determination, and gratitude. The
past few months have been a time of intense self-reflection, learning, and
growth, and I am emerging with a renewed commitment to the values of
compassion, integrity, and lifelong learning.</p>
<p>It has been weeks and months waiting for the investigator report and referral to
the FTP panel. I do not understand why this is taking so long when all the facts
had been laid out after the contempt of court hearing and the MPTS. I know that
I will face another “trial” at the university with FTP questioning but I also know
that I am not alone in this journey, and that I have the support of a community of
mentors, friends, and colleagues who believe in my potential and are committed
to helping me succeed.</p>
<p>One of my key priorities moving forward will be to continue engaging in ongoing
learning and professional development, both within and outside of my formal
training. This includes participating in workshops and seminars on ethics and
professionalism. Over the next few weeks, I will conclude at least three courses
on professionalism, ethics, morality and standards. I will update you on these
courses once it is concluded.</p>
<p>I am committed to living out the values of ethical practice and compassionate
care in everything that I do. I know that rebuilding trust and earning back the
confidence of those I have let down will be a long and difficult process, but I am
prepared to do the hard work necessary to demonstrate my integrity and my
dedication to the well-being of those I serve.</p>
<p>As I look to the future, I am filled with a sense of excitement and possibility. I
know that the road ahead will be challenging at times, but I also know that I
have the strength, the resilience, and the support I need to navigate whatever
comes my way. And I am grateful for the opportunity to use my experiences and
my voice to make a positive difference in the world.</p>
<p>To all those who have been a part of this journey with me, I offer my deepest
thanks and my ongoing commitment to growth, learning, and service. And to
those who may be facing their own challenges and uncertainties, I offer my
support, my encouragement, and my belief in your inherent worth and potential.</p>
<p>Together, let us build a more forgiving community that is grounded in
compassion, integrity, and a deep commitment to the well-being of all those we
serve. The road ahead may be long, but with each step, we are moving closer
to a brighter, more just, and more compassionate future.</p>

<p>The university has referred me to FTP and put me on full suspension from what
I understand. I am surprised on putting me on full suspension pending
investigation even though I have never committed through my almost 20 years
of medical practice a single breach of patient safety or trust. I have challenged
the decision, but the department would like the FTP panel to decide before I am
allowed to return to studies.</p>
<p>I am deeply saddened and disheartened by the decision to suspend me from
my studies until a decision is made by the FTP panel. While I fully acknowledge
the crucial importance of professional regulation in ensuring the highest
standards of patient care and public trust, I believe that my individual merits,
core values, and unwavering commitment to rebuilding trust should be the
primary considerations in this matter.</p>
<p>Throughout this challenging period, I have embarked on a transformative
journey of self-reflection, personal growth, and dedication to restoring faith in
my abilities as a healthcare professional. It is my sincere belief that the
overarching objective should be to support and foster my efforts to re-establish
a strong, trust-based relationship with both patients and the wider public.
It is with a heavy heart that I feel judged and condemned for actions that
occurred outside the scope of my professional practice. The absence of criminal
prosecution or a criminal record underscores the notion that my mistakes, while
serious, do not define me as a person or a future healthcare provider nor
underline any criminal offence. My case had been a civil offence throughout.</p>
<p>The weight of this decision bears heavily on my soul, as I grapple with the
realisation that this singular event may continue to cast a shadow over my
aspirations and hinder my ability to make a meaningful contribution to the field
of healthcare. I am deeply concerned that, despite my genuine efforts to atone
for my past and demonstrate my commitment to ethical and compassionate
care, I may forever be haunted by this unfortunate chapter in my life. I also feel
that a decision had been already made to throw me out no matter how much
effort I show with evidence. This blog is important to show my transparency and
commitment to keep everyone updated on my journey and how I feel at every
hurdle.</p>
<p>As I navigate the complex challenges of rebuilding trust and demonstrating my
fitness to practice, I have come to appreciate the incredible power of
mentorship. Throughout this journey, I have been fortunate to have the
guidance and support of several key individuals who have helped me to grow,
learn, and stay accountable to my commitments.</p>
<p>One of these mentors is a respected colleague that has been a constant source
of wisdom and encouragement. With years of experience navigating the
complexities of healthcare ethics and professionalism, this mentor has provided
invaluable insights into the strategies and practices that can help me to rebuild
trust and demonstrate my integrity over time.</p>
<p>Another key figure in my support network is another colleague, who has taken
on the role of a trusted advisor and confidant. This individual has been
instrumental in helping me to process my experiences, confront my mistakes,
and develop an unclouded vision for the kind of healthcare professional I want
to be. Through regular conversations and reflective exercises, this mentor has
challenged me to think deeply about my values, my goals, and the impact I want
to have on the lives of others.</p>
<p>I am also incredibly grateful for the support of my life coach, who has been a
constant source of encouragement and accountability throughout this process.
With a keen understanding of the psychological and emotional challenges of
personal growth and transformation, my coach has helped me to develop the
resilience, self-awareness, and coping strategies I need to stay focused on my
goals and navigate the inevitable setbacks and obstacles along the way.
Together, these mentors have formed an incredible support system that has
been essential to my growth and development. They have provided a safe
space for me to be vulnerable, to ask for help, and to explore the complex
emotions and challenges that come with the process of redemption. And they
have consistently reminded me of my inherent worth, my potential for positive
change, and the importance of staying true to my values and commitments.</p>
<p>As I move forward in my journey, I know that I will continue to rely on the
guidance and support of these incredible individuals. And I hope that my story
can serve as a reminder to others of the transformative power of mentorship
and the importance of seeking out the support and guidance we need to grow,
heal, and thrive.</p>
<p>To my mentors, I offer my deepest gratitude and my commitment to honour the
teachings and the trust invested in me despite all what had happened thus far.
And to all those who may be struggling with their own challenges and mistakes,
I encourage you to reach out for help and to surround yourself with people who
believe in your potential for growth and change.</p>
<p>Together, we can build a culture of compassion, accountability, and support that
enables all of us to become the best versions of ourselves and to make a
positive impact in the lives of those we serve.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="rebuilding-trust">Rebuilding Trust</h2>
<p>As I prepare to return to my studies at UCLAN and take the next steps in my
journey to becoming a dentist and maxillofacial surgeon, I know that rebuilding
trust will be one of my most important priorities. I understand that my past
actions have undermined confidence in my ability to practice safely and
ethically, and I am committed to doing everything in my power to demonstrate
my accountability and integrity moving forward.</p>
<p>One key aspect of this commitment is my plan to engage in ongoing monitoring
and supervision throughout my training and early career. I will work closely with
faculty mentors, clinical supervisors, and other trusted advisors to ensure that I
am always meeting the highest standards of professionalism and ethical
conduct. This will include regular check-ins, performance reviews, and
opportunities for feedback and guidance.</p>
<p>I am also committed to being fully transparent about my past and the steps I am
taking to learn from my mistakes. In my upcoming meeting with university
representatives, I plan to discuss my situation openly and honestly, sharing the
insights I have gained and the concrete actions I am taking to demonstrate my
fitness to practice. This includes my participation in ethics courses, my
engagement with professional support networks, and my ongoing efforts to
cultivate self-awareness and accountability.</p>
<p>Beyond my formal training, I am also actively seeking out opportunities to give
back to the community and make a positive impact in the lives of others. This
includes volunteering at UCLAN, participating in patient liaison groups, and
using my story to inspire others who may be struggling with their own
challenges.</p>
<p>I know that rebuilding trust will not happen overnight, and I am prepared for the
long journey ahead. But I am also confident that with hard work, dedication, and
an unwavering commitment to integrity, I can demonstrate my fitness to serve
patients and earn back the confidence of those I have let down.</p>
<p>To the patients, colleagues, and community members who have been impacted
by my actions, I offer my deepest apologies and my solemn pledge to do better.
Thank you for believing in the power of redemption and for supporting me on
this path to becoming a more accountable, compassionate, and trustworthy
healthcare professional.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="cultivating-insight">Cultivating Insight</h2>
<p>As I delve deeper into my journey of self-reflection, I have come to realise that
true growth begins with understanding the underlying factors that contributed to
my past mistakes. It is not enough to simply acknowledge what I did was wrong;
I must also examine why I made those choices and what I can do to ensure that
I never repeat them.</p>
<p>Through intense introspection and the guidance of my mentor and life coach, I
have gained valuable insights into my behaviour. I now recognise that I allowed
external pressures and personal stressors to cloud my judgment, leading me to
make decisions that were inconsistent with my values and the high standards of
my profession.</p>
<p>But I also understand that insight alone is not enough. To truly learn from my
mistakes, I must translate this understanding into concrete actions and
strategies for change. That is why I have been actively engaging in courses,
workshops, and other learning opportunities to build my ethical decision-making
skills and deepen my commitment to professional integrity.</p>
<p>One recent milestone in this process was completing a comprehensive course
on ethics and probity in healthcare. This experience was transformative,
providing me with a robust framework for navigating complex moral dilemmas
and reinforcing the importance of always putting patient well-being first. There
will be more commitment to taking further courses as the journey continues,
however I am also aware of the financial commitments to these courses as
some of them are expensive.</p>
<p>As I continue to cultivate insight and develop new skills, I feel a growing sense
of confidence in my ability to face future challenges with wisdom, compassion,
and a steadfast commitment to doing what is right. While the journey ahead
may be long, I am determined to use every opportunity to learn, grow, and
become the best version of myself.</p>
<p>To those who have been hurt by my actions, I want you to know that my
commitment to making amends is unwavering. I will continue to do the hard
work of self-reflection and self-improvement, not just for myself, but for the sake
of the patients and communities I hope to serve. Thank you for being a part of
this journey of growth and redemption. Your support means everything to me.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Journey Begins]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-journey-begins!">The Journey Begins!</h2>
<p>Today marks a turning point in my life. As I reflect on the events that have led
me to this moment, I am filled with a mix of emotions – regret for my past
actions, gratitude for the opportunity to make amends, and a deep
determination to become a better person and healthcare professional. I was
given 28 days only to appeal the decision. I reflected deeply on this and in
addition to the financial resources that I need to commit to such a step, there
will be the time spent in a debacle and further struggle rather than healing and
growing.</p>
<p>I have made mistakes, and I take full responsibility for them. The consequences
of my actions have been severe, including a suspended prison sentence and
erasure from the GMC register. But I refuse to let these define me. Instead, I
choose to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and positive
change.
Over the past months, I have embarked on a journey of self-reflection and
insight, collaborating closely with mentors and coaches to understand the root
causes of my behaviour and develop strategies to ensure that I never repeat
these mistakes. It has not been easy, but I am committed to doing the hard work
necessary to rebuild trust and prove myself worthy of the privilege of serving
patients once again.</p>
<p>As I prepare to return to my studies at UCLAN and pursue my dream of
becoming a dentist and maxillofacial surgeon, I know that transparency and
accountability will be key. In the coming weeks, I plan my return to the university
and share the steps that I am taking to demonstrate my insight and remediation
thus far.</p>
<p>To the patients and public who have been impacted by my actions, I offer my
deepest apologies. I know that I have a long way to go to regain your trust, but I
am determined to do so through my actions and my unwavering commitment to
ethical practice. However, the journey had started back in the year 2022 with
reflections and an attempt to develop myself that culminated in a plan
developed with the support of my colleagues during the MPTS trial.
This is just the beginning of my journey, but I am ready to face the challenges
ahead and emerge a stronger, more compassionate, and more principled
healthcare professional. Thank you for joining me on this path. Your support and
understanding mean the world to me.</p>
