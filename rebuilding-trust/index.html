        <h2 id="rebuilding-trust">Rebuilding Trust</h2>
<p>As I prepare to return to my studies at UCLAN and take the next steps in my
journey to becoming a dentist and maxillofacial surgeon, I know that rebuilding
trust will be one of my most important priorities. I understand that my past
actions have undermined confidence in my ability to practice safely and
ethically, and I am committed to doing everything in my power to demonstrate
my accountability and integrity moving forward.</p>
<p>One key aspect of this commitment is my plan to engage in ongoing monitoring
and supervision throughout my training and early career. I will work closely with
faculty mentors, clinical supervisors, and other trusted advisors to ensure that I
am always meeting the highest standards of professionalism and ethical
conduct. This will include regular check-ins, performance reviews, and
opportunities for feedback and guidance.</p>
<p>I am also committed to being fully transparent about my past and the steps I am
taking to learn from my mistakes. In my upcoming meeting with university
representatives, I plan to discuss my situation openly and honestly, sharing the
insights I have gained and the concrete actions I am taking to demonstrate my
fitness to practice. This includes my participation in ethics courses, my
engagement with professional support networks, and my ongoing efforts to
cultivate self-awareness and accountability.</p>
<p>Beyond my formal training, I am also actively seeking out opportunities to give
back to the community and make a positive impact in the lives of others. This
includes volunteering at UCLAN, participating in patient liaison groups, and
using my story to inspire others who may be struggling with their own
challenges.</p>
<p>I know that rebuilding trust will not happen overnight, and I am prepared for the
long journey ahead. But I am also confident that with hard work, dedication, and
an unwavering commitment to integrity, I can demonstrate my fitness to serve
patients and earn back the confidence of those I have let down.</p>
<p>To the patients, colleagues, and community members who have been impacted
by my actions, I offer my deepest apologies and my solemn pledge to do better.
Thank you for believing in the power of redemption and for supporting me on
this path to becoming a more accountable, compassionate, and trustworthy
healthcare professional.</p>
