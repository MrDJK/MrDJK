<p>As I stand on the threshold of a new chapter in my personal and professional
journey, I am still filled with a sense of hope, determination, and gratitude. The
past few months have been a time of intense self-reflection, learning, and
growth, and I am emerging with a renewed commitment to the values of
compassion, integrity, and lifelong learning.</p>
<p>It has been weeks and months waiting for the investigator report and referral to
the FTP panel. I do not understand why this is taking so long when all the facts
had been laid out after the contempt of court hearing and the MPTS. I know that
I will face another “trial” at the university with FTP questioning but I also know
that I am not alone in this journey, and that I have the support of a community of
mentors, friends, and colleagues who believe in my potential and are committed
to helping me succeed.</p>
<p>One of my key priorities moving forward will be to continue engaging in ongoing
learning and professional development, both within and outside of my formal
training. This includes participating in workshops and seminars on ethics and
professionalism. Over the next few weeks, I will conclude at least three courses
on professionalism, ethics, morality and standards. I will update you on these
courses once it is concluded.</p>
<p>I am committed to living out the values of ethical practice and compassionate
care in everything that I do. I know that rebuilding trust and earning back the
confidence of those I have let down will be a long and difficult process, but I am
prepared to do the hard work necessary to demonstrate my integrity and my
dedication to the well-being of those I serve.</p>
<p>As I look to the future, I am filled with a sense of excitement and possibility. I
know that the road ahead will be challenging at times, but I also know that I
have the strength, the resilience, and the support I need to navigate whatever
comes my way. And I am grateful for the opportunity to use my experiences and
my voice to make a positive difference in the world.</p>
<p>To all those who have been a part of this journey with me, I offer my deepest
thanks and my ongoing commitment to growth, learning, and service. And to
those who may be facing their own challenges and uncertainties, I offer my
support, my encouragement, and my belief in your inherent worth and potential.</p>
<p>Together, let us build a more forgiving community that is grounded in
compassion, integrity, and a deep commitment to the well-being of all those we
serve. The road ahead may be long, but with each step, we are moving closer
to a brighter, more just, and more compassionate future.</p>
