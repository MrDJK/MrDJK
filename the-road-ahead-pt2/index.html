        <h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>It has been almost a month since my meeting with the university, and I find
myself reflecting on the profound impact that conversation has had on my
personal and professional journey. The meeting was literally a 5 minutes’
meeting. The decision was to send the case to the FTP panel. All investigations
and decisions relating to this matter were concluded in July 2023. In my initial
meeting with the investigator at the university, he clearly decided that this matter
will go to panel. I do not understand why it has taken more than 8 months to
decide that again.</p>
<p>Waiting for the meeting, I was hoping that a decision would be made to look at
this matter without it being overshadowed by the decisions already made. This
investigation according to my understanding needed to be independent and
take into consideration the whole journey. I mean almost a year has passed
now. I knew that I had to confront my past mistakes head-on, to take full
responsibility for my actions, and to convey the depth of my remorse and the
sincerity of my efforts to make amends. I was prepared to answer tough
questions and to provide concrete evidence of the work I had done to address
the concerns raised about my fitness to practice.</p>
<p>As the meeting unfolded, I was shocked to realise that the purpose of the
meeting was to inform me that this matter was to be referred to panel. I found
myself drawing strength from the very experiences that had brought me to this
point. In my mind I was clear and candid about the lessons I had learned from
my legal and professional challenges, the insights I had gained through self-
reflection and the guidance of mentors, and the steps I had taken to rebuild trust
and demonstrate my commitment to ethical conduct.</p>
<p>I have planned the courses I wanted to take and had completed two courses.
There was a third course planned for May. What really concerns me is that the
university had suspended me now for 8 months without assigning me a mentor
or giving me guidance to see how I am investing my time. This is the time that
support is needed, and help should be guided. However, I am glad for my life
coach to helping me through the journey and providing me guidance and
support and space to talk and reflect. The ongoing support and accountability
measure I had put in place to ensure that I am always striving to meet the
highest standards of professionalism kept me going and steadily firm on this
journey. I speak with my life coach about the transformative power of empathy,
the importance of transparency and honesty, and my unwavering dedication to
becoming a healthcare professional who has the highest degree of probity and
accountability.</p>
<p>As I left the meeting, I felt abandoned and without real guidance and so many
questions not answered. Why has this taken so long and if a decision on day
one to take this to panel why was this not acted upon.
However, in my reflections the inner strength to face whatever challenges lay
ahead and to be resilient despite all obstacles and to take ownership of my own
actions, plans and future will always keep me holding on to hope.
In the weeks since the meeting, I have continued to reflect on the lessons
learned and to apply them in my daily life. I have redoubled my efforts to
engage with the community, to seek out opportunities for growth and learning,
and to surround myself with positive influences and mentors who challenge me
to be my best self.</p>
<p>I know that the journey of redemption and personal growth is a lifelong one, and
I am committed to staying the course, no matter what obstacles may arise. I am
excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I am confident that with hard
work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to ethical practice, I can
become the kind of dental professional that patients deserve.
To all those who have supported me along the way - my family, friends,
mentors, and the wider healthcare community - I offer my deepest gratitude.
Your belief in me and your encouragement have been a constant source of
strength and inspiration, and I will continue to draw upon them as I move
forward on this path.</p>
<p>And to those who may be facing their own challenges and setbacks, I offer this
message of hope: no matter how far you may have fallen, no matter how
daunting the road ahead may seem, there is always the possibility of
redemption, of growth, and of positive change. With courage, humility, and a
commitment to doing what is right, anything is possible.
Thank you for being a part of this journey with me. I look forward to sharing
more updates and reflections as I continue this path of personal and
professional growth.</p>
