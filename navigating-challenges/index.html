<p>As I sit down to write this blog post, I find myself reflecting on a month filled with
both accomplishments and challenges. While I have made significant strides in
my personal and professional growth, I have also encountered obstacles that
have tested my resilience and determination.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of this month has been completing another course in
ethics. This course has built upon the knowledge and skills I gained in previous
ethics courses, further deepening my understanding of the moral and
professional responsibilities I hold as a healthcare provider. Through engaging
discussions, thought-provoking case studies, and reflective assignments, I have
gained valuable insights into the complexities of ethical decision-making and the
importance of maintaining the highest standards of integrity in all aspects of my
work.</p>
<p>However, my joy in completing this course has been tempered by frustration
and disappointment regarding my interactions with the university. Despite my
repeated requests for the student union to be present at a scheduled meeting,
there was a lack of effort to accommodate this request. The absence of the
student advisor from the student union has left me feeling unsupported and
alone in navigating the challenges I face.
As a result of this lack of support, I have asked for the meeting to be
rearranged. Originally scheduled for June, the meeting has now been
postponed, adding to the uncertainty and stress I am currently experiencing. It
is disheartening to feel that my needs and concerns are not being adequately
addressed by the very institution that should be supporting me in my journey of
growth and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, during my recent visit to Lebanon, I suffered a fracture
to my fifth metatarsal. The pain has been excruciating, making it difficult to
sleep at night and adding an additional layer of physical and emotional stress to
an already challenging situation. The agony of the injury has been compounded
by the frustration of feeling unsupported and alone in my struggles. Upon my
arrival back to the UK, I have arranged to see fracture clinic and discuss with
my GP. I have needed loads of painkillers to support me through the pain.
Despite these setbacks, I am trying to remain focused on my goals and the
progress I have made thus far. I know that growth and healing are not always
linear processes and that there will be obstacles and challenges along the way.
However, it is in these moments of adversity that I must dig deep and find the
strength to persevere.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the support of my life coach, psychologist, and the network of
mentors and colleagues who have been by my side throughout this journey.
Their guidance, encouragement, and belief in me have been a constant source
of strength and motivation, even in the darkest of times.
To those reading this blog, I want to emphasise the importance of seeking
support when faced with challenges and setbacks. It is okay to ask for help, to
lean on others, and to advocate for your needs. We are not meant to navigate
life's difficulties alone, and there is no shame in reaching out for the support and
guidance we need to thrive.</p>
<p>As I move forward, I am committed to continuing my journey of growth and
learning, even in the face of adversity. I will continue to engage in courses and
activities that challenge me to be my best self, to seek out the support and
resources I need to succeed, and to use my experiences to make a positive
difference in the world.
To my fellow travellers on the path of personal and professional growth, I offer
my solidarity and support. Together, we can overcome even the greatest of
obstacles and emerge stronger, wiser, and more compassionate than ever
before.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of this journey with me. I look forward to sharing
more updates and reflections as I continue this path of healing, growth, and
resilience.
With determination and hope,</p>
