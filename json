The\npast few months have been a time of intense self-reflection, learning, and\ngrowth, and I am emerging with a renewed commitment to the values of\ncompassion, integrity, and lifelong learning.</p>\n<p>It has been weeks and months waiting for the investigator report and referral to\nthe FTP panel. I do not understand why this is taking so long when all the facts\nhad been laid out after the contempt of court hearing and the MPTS. I know that\nI will face another “trial” at the university with FTP questioning but I also know\nthat I am not alone in this journey, and that I have the support of a community of\nmentors, friends, and colleagues who believe in my potential and are committed\nto helping me succeed.</p>\n<p>One of my key priorities moving forward will be to continue engaging in ongoing\nlearning and professional development, both within and outside of my formal\ntraining. This includes participating in workshops and seminars on ethics and\nprofessionalism. Over the next few weeks, I will conclude at least three courses\non professionalism, ethics, morality and standards. I will update you on these\ncourses once it is concluded.</p>\n<p>I am committed to living out the values of ethical practice and compassionate\ncare in everything that I do. I know that rebuilding trust and earning back the\nconfidence of those I have let down will be a long and difficult process, but I am\nprepared to do the hard work necessary to demonstrate my integrity and my\ndedication to the well-being of those I serve.</p>\n<p>As I look to the future, I am filled with a sense of excitement and possibility. I\nknow that the road ahead will be challenging at times, but I also know that I\nhave the strength, the resilience, and the support I need to navigate whatever\ncomes my way. And I am grateful for the opportunity to use my experiences and\nmy voice to make a positive difference in the world.</p>\n<p>To all those who have been a part of this journey with me, I offer my deepest\nthanks and my ongoing commitment to growth, learning, and service. And to\nthose who may be facing their own challenges and uncertainties, I offer my\nsupport, my encouragement, and my belief in your inherent worth and potential.</p>\n<p>Together, let us build a more forgiving community that is grounded in\ncompassion, integrity, and a deep commitment to the well-being of all those we\nserve. The road ahead may be long, but with each step, we are moving closer\nto a brighter, more just, and more compassionate future.</p>\n",

I understand that my past\nactions have undermined confidence in my ability to practice safely and\nethically, and I am committed to doing everything in my power to demonstrate\nmy accountability and integrity moving forward.</p>\n<p>One key aspect of this commitment is my plan to engage in ongoing monitoring\nand supervision throughout my training and early career. I will work closely with\nfaculty mentors, clinical supervisors, and other trusted advisors to ensure that I\nam always meeting the highest standards of professionalism and ethical\nconduct. This will include regular check-ins, performance reviews, and\nopportunities for feedback and guidance.</p>\n<p>I am also committed to being fully transparent about my past and the steps I am\ntaking to learn from my mistakes. In my upcoming meeting with university\nrepresentatives, I plan to discuss my situation openly and honestly, sharing the\ninsights I have gained and the concrete actions I am taking to demonstrate my\nfitness to practice. This includes my participation in ethics courses, my\nengagement with professional support networks, and my ongoing efforts to\ncultivate self-awareness and accountability.</p>\n<p>Beyond my formal training, I am also actively seeking out opportunities to give\nback to the community and make a positive impact in the lives of others. This\nincludes volunteering at UCLAN, participating in patient liaison groups, and\nusing my story to inspire others who may be struggling with their own\nchallenges.</p>\n<p>I know that rebuilding trust will not happen overnight, and I am prepared for the\nlong journey ahead.

It is not enough to simply acknowledge what I did was wrong;\nI must also examine why I made those choices and what I can do to ensure that\nI never repeat them.</p>\n<p>Through intense introspection and the guidance of my mentor and life coach, I\nhave gained valuable insights into my behaviour. I now recognise that I allowed\nexternal pressures and personal stressors to cloud my judgment, leading me to\nmake decisions that were inconsistent with my values and the high standards of\nmy profession.</p>\n<p>But I also understand that insight alone is not enough. To truly learn from my\nmistakes, I must translate this understanding into concrete actions and\nstrategies for change. That is why I have been actively engaging in courses,\nworkshops, and other learning opportunities to build my ethical decision-making\nskills and deepen my commitment to professional integrity.</p>\n<p>One recent milestone in this process was completing a comprehensive course\non ethics and probity in healthcare. This experience was transformative,\nproviding me with a robust framework for navigating complex moral dilemmas\nand reinforcing the importance of always putting patient well-being first. There\nwill be more commitment to taking further courses as the journey continues,\nhowever I am also aware of the financial commitments to these courses as\nsome of them are expensive.</p>\n<p>As I continue to cultivate insight and develop new skills, I feel a growing sense\nof confidence in my ability to face future challenges with wisdom, compassion,\nand a steadfast commitment to doing what is right. While the journey ahead\nmay be long, I am determined to use every opportunity to learn, grow, and\nbecome the best version of myself.</p>\n<p>To those who have been hurt by my actions, I want you to know that my\ncommitment to making amends is unwavering. I will continue to do the hard\nwork of self-reflection and self-improvement, not just for myself, but for the sake\nof the patients and communities I hope to serve.

As I reflect on the events that have led\nme to this moment, I am filled with a mix of emotions – regret for my past\nactions, gratitude for the opportunity to make amends, and a deep\ndetermination to become a better person and healthcare professional. I was\ngiven 28 days only to appeal the decision. I reflected deeply on this and in\naddition to the financial resources that I need to commit to such a step, there\nwill be the time spent in a debacle and further struggle rather than healing and\ngrowing.</p>\n<p>I have made mistakes, and I take full responsibility for them. The consequences\nof my actions have been severe, including a suspended prison sentence and\nerasure from the GMC register. But I refuse to let these define me. Instead, I\nchoose to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and positive\nchange.\nOver the past months, I have embarked on a journey of self-reflection and\ninsight, collaborating closely with mentors and coaches to understand the root\ncauses of my behaviour and develop strategies to ensure that I never repeat\nthese mistakes. It has not been easy, but I am committed to doing the hard work\nnecessary to rebuild trust and prove myself worthy of the privilege of serving\npatients once again.</p>\n<p>As I prepare to return to my studies at UCLAN and pursue my dream of\nbecoming a dentist and maxillofacial surgeon, I know that transparency and\naccountability will be key. In the coming weeks, I plan my return to the university\nand share the steps that I am taking to demonstrate my insight and remediation\nthus far.</p>\n<p>To the patients and public who have been impacted by my actions, I offer my\ndeepest apologies. I know that I have a long way to go to regain your trust, but I\nam determined to do so through my actions and my unwavering commitment to\nethical practice. However, the journey had started back in the year 2022 with\nreflections and an attempt to develop myself that culminated in a plan\ndeveloped with the support of my colleagues during the MPTS trial.\nThis is just the beginning of my journey, but I am ready to face the challenges\nahead and emerge a stronger, more compassionate, and more principled\nhealthcare professional. Thank you for joining me on this path. Your support and\nunderstanding mean the world to me.</p>\n",
