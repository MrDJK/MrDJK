<p>Today marks a turning point in my life. As I reflect on the events that have led
me to this moment, I am filled with a mix of emotions – regret for my past
actions, gratitude for the opportunity to make amends, and a deep
determination to become a better person and healthcare professional. I was
given 28 days only to appeal the decision. I reflected deeply on this and in
addition to the financial resources that I need to commit to such a step, there
will be the time spent in a debacle and further struggle rather than healing and
growing.</p>
<p>I have made mistakes, and I take full responsibility for them. The consequences
of my actions have been severe, including a suspended prison sentence and
erasure from the GMC register. But I refuse to let these define me. Instead, I
choose to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and positive
change.
Over the past months, I have embarked on a journey of self-reflection and
insight, collaborating closely with mentors and coaches to understand the root
causes of my behaviour and develop strategies to ensure that I never repeat
these mistakes. It has not been easy, but I am committed to doing the hard work
necessary to rebuild trust and prove myself worthy of the privilege of serving
patients once again.</p>
<p>As I prepare to return to my studies at UCLAN and pursue my dream of
becoming a dentist and maxillofacial surgeon, I know that transparency and
accountability will be key. In the coming weeks, I plan my return to the university
and share the steps that I am taking to demonstrate my insight and remediation
thus far.</p>
<p>To the patients and public who have been impacted by my actions, I offer my
deepest apologies. I know that I have a long way to go to regain your trust, but I
am determined to do so through my actions and my unwavering commitment to
ethical practice. However, the journey had started back in the year 2022 with
reflections and an attempt to develop myself that culminated in a plan
developed with the support of my colleagues during the MPTS trial.
This is just the beginning of my journey, but I am ready to face the challenges
ahead and emerge a stronger, more compassionate, and more principled
healthcare professional. Thank you for joining me on this path. Your support and
understanding mean the world to me.</p>
