<p>The university has referred me to FTP and put me on full suspension from what
I understand. I am surprised on putting me on full suspension pending
investigation even though I have never committed through my almost 20 years
of medical practice a single breach of patient safety or trust. I have challenged
the decision, but the department would like the FTP panel to decide before I am
allowed to return to studies.</p>
<p>I am deeply saddened and disheartened by the decision to suspend me from
my studies until a decision is made by the FTP panel. While I fully acknowledge
the crucial importance of professional regulation in ensuring the highest
standards of patient care and public trust, I believe that my individual merits,
core values, and unwavering commitment to rebuilding trust should be the
primary considerations in this matter.</p>
<p>Throughout this challenging period, I have embarked on a transformative
journey of self-reflection, personal growth, and dedication to restoring faith in
my abilities as a healthcare professional. It is my sincere belief that the
overarching objective should be to support and foster my efforts to re-establish
a strong, trust-based relationship with both patients and the wider public.
It is with a heavy heart that I feel judged and condemned for actions that
occurred outside the scope of my professional practice. The absence of criminal
prosecution or a criminal record underscores the notion that my mistakes, while
serious, do not define me as a person or a future healthcare provider nor
underline any criminal offence. My case had been a civil offence throughout.</p>
<p>The weight of this decision bears heavily on my soul, as I grapple with the
realisation that this singular event may continue to cast a shadow over my
aspirations and hinder my ability to make a meaningful contribution to the field
of healthcare. I am deeply concerned that, despite my genuine efforts to atone
for my past and demonstrate my commitment to ethical and compassionate
care, I may forever be haunted by this unfortunate chapter in my life. I also feel
that a decision had been already made to throw me out no matter how much
effort I show with evidence. This blog is important to show my transparency and
commitment to keep everyone updated on my journey and how I feel at every
hurdle.</p>
<p>As I navigate the complex challenges of rebuilding trust and demonstrating my
fitness to practice, I have come to appreciate the incredible power of
mentorship. Throughout this journey, I have been fortunate to have the
guidance and support of several key individuals who have helped me to grow,
learn, and stay accountable to my commitments.</p>
<p>One of these mentors is a respected colleague that has been a constant source
of wisdom and encouragement. With years of experience navigating the
complexities of healthcare ethics and professionalism, this mentor has provided
invaluable insights into the strategies and practices that can help me to rebuild
trust and demonstrate my integrity over time.</p>
<p>Another key figure in my support network is another colleague, who has taken
on the role of a trusted advisor and confidant. This individual has been
instrumental in helping me to process my experiences, confront my mistakes,
and develop an unclouded vision for the kind of healthcare professional I want
to be. Through regular conversations and reflective exercises, this mentor has
challenged me to think deeply about my values, my goals, and the impact I want
to have on the lives of others.</p>
<p>I am also incredibly grateful for the support of my life coach, who has been a
constant source of encouragement and accountability throughout this process.
With a keen understanding of the psychological and emotional challenges of
personal growth and transformation, my coach has helped me to develop the
resilience, self-awareness, and coping strategies I need to stay focused on my
goals and navigate the inevitable setbacks and obstacles along the way.
Together, these mentors have formed an incredible support system that has
been essential to my growth and development. They have provided a safe
space for me to be vulnerable, to ask for help, and to explore the complex
emotions and challenges that come with the process of redemption. And they
have consistently reminded me of my inherent worth, my potential for positive
change, and the importance of staying true to my values and commitments.</p>
<p>As I move forward in my journey, I know that I will continue to rely on the
guidance and support of these incredible individuals. And I hope that my story
can serve as a reminder to others of the transformative power of mentorship
and the importance of seeking out the support and guidance we need to grow,
heal, and thrive.</p>
<p>To my mentors, I offer my deepest gratitude and my commitment to honour the
teachings and the trust invested in me despite all what had happened thus far.
And to all those who may be struggling with their own challenges and mistakes,
I encourage you to reach out for help and to surround yourself with people who
believe in your potential for growth and change.</p>
<p>Together, we can build a culture of compassion, accountability, and support that
enables all of us to become the best versions of ourselves and to make a
positive impact in the lives of those we serve.</p>
